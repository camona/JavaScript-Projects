# JavaScript Projects

I love to practice coding doing projects. I found some projects ideas on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-create-a-color-flipper) and decided to work on them. This way I get to have fun and also learn new stuff. Most of the CSS is copied to save time and to focus more on the JavaScript.

In this folder you will find the following projects:
- Color Flipper 🎨
- Counter 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣
- Reviews 📊
- Navbar 🗂️
