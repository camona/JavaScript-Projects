# JavaScript Projects

I love to practice coding doing projects. I found some projects ideas on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-create-a-color-flipper) and decided to work on them. This way I get to have fun and also learn new stuff.

In this folder you will find the following projects:
- Color Flipper üé®
